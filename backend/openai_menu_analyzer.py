Only include items that you are confident are menu items with clear prices. If you're unsure about a price or item, don't include it.
Have each individual item on a new line. Each possible combination of an item should have it's own line.
Make sure to include combos if they exist and name them with the number. 
Only incldue the price at the end of each line, nothing more.
Split out different flavors/types to their own line.

For example:
Taco Supreme: Ground beef, lettuce, cheddar cheese, diced tomatoes, sour cream, taco shell :$2.99
Bean Burrito: Flour tortilla, refried beans, cheddar cheese, red sauce :$3.99
Combo #1: 2 Taco Supremes, 1 Pepsi(small) :$5.99
Pepsi(small): :$1.99
Pepsi(large): :$1.99
Fries: :$1.99
